## Asking quality questions

Questions can go to [Github discussions][discussions].

Help us help you!
Spend time framing questions & add links & resources.
Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
Here are some tips:

- [Talk to a duck][rubberduck]!
- Donâ€™t fall for the [XY problem][xy]
- Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering & what steps have you taken to try & fix it?
  - Is there a concept you donâ€™t understand?
- Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox][cs] or video, if possible
- Screenshots can help, but if thereâ€™s important text such as code or error
  messages in them, please also provide those as text
- The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
