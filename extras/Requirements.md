# [Project 2 Requirements](https://github.com/2206-devops-batch/trainer-code/blob/master/project-2.md)

Automated CI/CD pipeline for a web application (default: flask-demo)

Building off of your CI pipeline for project 1, extend its features with continuous delivery and deployment strategies like:

- Private Staging/Public Production environment/servers
- Separate testing environment/servers
- Blue/Green deployment
- Canary deployment

Presentation will be a simple demonstration of a blue/green deployment where a new version of an application seamlessly replaces the old without any interruption of service.

Expected tools:

- GitHub
- Jenkins
- Docker & DockerHub
- Kubernetes (EKS on AWS)

Nice to haves:

- Helm charts
- Jenkins on Kubernetes

Fallback, when all else fails:

- Local Kubernetes cluster (minikube or Docker Desktop)

Presentation day:

- Tuesday, July 19
- 5-10 minutes demonstration
- Small slideshow with each team member presenting one slide of information
